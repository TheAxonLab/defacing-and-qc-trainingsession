# Defacing and QC project: reports of the training session 
MRIQC version 23.1.0 derivatives generated from several publicly available datasets <sup>[1,2,3,4]</sup> in the context of the [defacing and qc project](https://github.com/TheAxonLab/defacing-and-qc-analysis).
Those T1w reports were selected to present a wide range of data quality. In the training session, the raters were asked to independently rate the 20 images and we then discuss their ratings together to ensure that the quality criteria used were interpreted consistently.

How to download this dataset (requires DataLad):

```
datalad install https://github.com/TheAxonLab/defacing-and-qc-trainingsession.git
```
